1.Code Analysis for Security (CI-CD 3Tier): Code analysis for security in a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline in a 3-tier architecture typically involves integrating security scanning tools into the pipeline to identify and remediate security vulnerabilities in the codebase.

2.Implement infrastructure as code (IaC): Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is an approach to managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files or code, rather than manually configuring hardware or interactive configuration tools. With IaC, infrastructure resources such as virtual machines, networks, storage, and other components are defined and managed using code, enabling automation, repeatability, and consistency in the deployment and management of infrastructure.

3.Monitor and log application performance: Monitoring and logging application performance involves tracking and analyzing various metrics and logs generated by an application to gain insights into its behavior, performance, and health.
